# Roguey

Very simple roguelike videogame made using SDL 2.0.

The code expects a folder called 'Media' with art (spritesheets) and fonts. Unfortunately the art I have used is under copyright so I cannot distribute it.

--------------------

I created this game to start learning c++ so it is not very sophisticated and may have some not-very-good practices here and there. However, I think it may be a good example or starting point for someone wanting to learn C++ or SDL 2.0.
